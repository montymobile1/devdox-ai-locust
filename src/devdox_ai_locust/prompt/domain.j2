Based on this API analysis, create domain-specific user flows for Locust testing:

API Analysis:
{{domain_analysis}}

Endpoints Available:
{{ endpoints }}  # Limit for token efficiency

Generate a Python file with domain-specific user flow classes that extend the base CustomUserFlow.
Focus on realistic business workflows that users would actually perform.

Requirements:
1. Create 2-3 domain-specific flow classes
2. Use sequential tasks for related API calls and use coorelation between them
3. To check payload and update it if it is not valid
4. Each flow should represent a complete business process
5. Include proper error handling and realistic wait times
6. Use the available endpoints in logical sequences
7. Add meaningful logging and data tracking

Always return your code wrapped in <code></code> tags with no explanations outside the tags DO NOT TRUNCATE THE CODE.
IMPORTANT: Return the SAME code with ONLY formatting fixes. Do not enhance or add anything
Format: <code>your_python_code_here</code>
